# What is a Web Developer?
  Before moving into the theory, it is interesting to address what exactly a web developer is, what problems he/she will be dealing with on a daily basis and why this matters.
## The history of the web
  In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the beggining of the Web as we know it: the Hypertext Markup Language, a.k.a. HTML. It came from the necessity of encapsulating data and defining the structure of a page, independently of the interpreter - in this case, the browser. It is a way of telling the browser the format of data, so it can be displayed as intended by the author of the page. It just felt more interesting to use a mark-up language to do so.
  
  As the web became popular during the 90s, it also became necessary to start building non-static - or dynamic - web pages. This means that at some point in the history of the world wide web, developers started applying persistence methods - through databases - to deliver different content to different visitors of a website. At this point, the necessity of having an intermediate medium to fetch the data and build the dynamic web pages became necessary. In 1995 PHP was born: a scripting and interpreted programming language. Its flexibility was attractive and it became the most popular programming language for web development.
  
  In the same year, there was another boundary to be beaten: the synchronous and static character of the web page construction. Why does every web page has to be fully built by the server? What about making it possible to mutate the web page in the browser? The answer to these questions is JavaScript, another flexible and interpreted language. It reads the web page as a tree, manipulating it at the developer's will.
  
  One year later, in 1996, the Cascading Style Sheet was created, aiming to simplify the style of the HTML.
  
  At this point, the foundation of web development was built: the front and back-end: the distinction - or separation of concerns - between the presentation layer (interface, front), and the business logic and data access layer (back) of web applications.
