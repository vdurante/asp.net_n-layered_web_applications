# ASP.NET N-Layered Web Applications
 Written by Vitor Durante
 
## Foreword

  I spent two years working with pure PHP after funding my first company. During that time, I rewrote the whole web platform five times. But still, the whole code was unreadable and tangled. I noticed something was wrong. After spending weeks working on my own framework, I met the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) world. I was still a novice, but the concept of a Model-View-Controller architecture was appealing.
 
  It just occurred to me that I knew nothing after all. At this point, I took a break from web development. I spent a whole year studying abroad, working on new, diversified projects.
 
  After that year, a new company had taken place and I had the opportunity to seek a new beginning. This time, I started working with [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc). As my applications grew in size, it became clear that the MVC architecture was not enough. It was great for a small company, but it started to fall short in some aspects as my company grew in size and complexity.
 
   Seeking the state of the art - yet [robust](http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/bishop/secprog/robust.html) - web development practices, I met [ASP.NET Boilerplate](http://aspnetboilerplate.com/). After months struggling with its low learning curve (from my perspective), I decided to write this book.
   
  The intention is to present and carefully explain the best practices of software architecture, design pattern, modern web development and more. The book displays theory and practices through the usage of the framework, all explained by examples. It also implements a few applications. Feel free to skip the theoretical part if you are already familiar.
   
   After this book, I expect you to have a solid foundation to build your own industrial-tier modern web applications.
   
## Why I Wrote This Book

When I start working with new programming languages, architectures, designs, frameworks and concepts in general, I usually feel lost and overwhelmed at first. It takes some time to master everything necessary to start feeling comfortable and secure that I am doing everything the right way. I felt the same when I started working with C#, ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Boilerplate.

After bad experiences with my first company, I felt the necessity to seek best practices on web development. From this experience on, I started investing several hours per week studying theories related to my fields of interest: Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Web Development in C#.

However, this time I decided to write a book on my free time to document everything I learned during these past years of studies and practices. I didn't intend to write everything from zero, since I don't feel capable of doing so. Instead, I decided to compile only the important segments in a simplistic book that would allow a complete beginner to program web applications the right way.

I must make it clear that apart from the practical examples (Part II and onward), I didn't generate all the content of this book. I call it a book due to its size, but I see it as fragments of important and spread concepts that I stumbled upon during my research and studies. Everything is available for free on the internet. You can read more about these resources at "Extra Resources" sections throughout Part I.

The examples were entirely written by me using ASP.NET Boilerplate, sometimes inspired by famous books and resources of MVC development, but working with frameworks other than ASP.NET Boilerplate. These resources are also available for free on the internet and will be presented throughout the book, for the sake of comparison. 

This book should be reliable, but don't take everything I write as the absolute truth. Acquiring knowledge is a never-ending process. I intend to update this book as long as I am learning new things.

## Part I. Building The Theoretical Foundation

Part one describes the theory behind robust programming, software architecture, software engineering, design patterns, general conventions, C# language, the ASP.NET MVC framework and the ASP.NET Boilerplate framework.
