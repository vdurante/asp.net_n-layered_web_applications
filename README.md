# ASP.NET N-Layered Web Applications
 Written by Vitor Durante
 
## Foreword

  I spent two years working with pure PHP after funding my first company. During that time, I rewrote the whole web platform five times. But still, the whole code was unreadable and tangled. I noticed something was wrong. After spending weeks working on my own framework, I met the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) world. I was still a novice, but the concept of a Model-View-Controller architecture was appealing.
 
  It just occurred to me that I knew nothing after all. At this point, I took a break from web development. I spent a whole year studying abroad, working on new, diversified projects.
 
  After that year, a new company had taken place and I had the opportunity to seek a new beginning. This time, I started working with [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc). As my applications grew in size, it became clear that the MVC architecture was not enough. It was great for a small company, but it started to fall short in some aspects as my company grew in size and complexity.
 
   Seeking the state of the art - yet [robust](http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/bishop/secprog/robust.html) - web development practices, I met [ASP.NET Boilerplate](http://aspnetboilerplate.com/). After months struggling with its low learning curve, I decided to write this book.
   
  The intention is to present and carefully explain the best practices of software architecture, design pattern, modern web development and more. The book displays theory and practices through the usage of the framework, all explained by examples. It also implements a few applications. Feel free to skip the theoretical part if you are already familiar.
   
   After this book, I expect you to have a solid foundation to build your own industrial-tier modern web applications.
   
   Enjoy!
