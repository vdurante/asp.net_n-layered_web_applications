# ASP.NET Boilerplate Book
 Written by Vitor Durante


## Foreword
 I spent two years working with pure PHP after funding my first company. During that time, I rewrote the whole web platform five times. But still, the whole code was unreadable and tangled. I noticed something was wrong. After spending weeks working on my own framework, I met the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) world. I was still a novice, but the concept of a Model-View-Controller architecture was appealing.
 
 It just occurred to me that I knew nothing after all. At this point, I took a break from web development. I spent a whole year studying abroad, working on new, diversified projects.
 
 After that year, a new company had taken place and I had the opportunity to seek a new beginning. This time, I started working with [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc). As my applications grew in size, it became clear that the MVC architecture was not enough. It was great for a small company, but it started to fall short in some aspects as my company grew in size and complexity.
 
   Seeking the state of the art - yet [robust](http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/bishop/secprog/robust.html) - web development practices, I met [ASP.NET Boilerplate](http://aspnetboilerplate.com/). After months struggling with its low learning curve, I decided to write this book.
   
   This book intents to present and carefully explain the best practices of software architecture, design patterns, web development and many more.
