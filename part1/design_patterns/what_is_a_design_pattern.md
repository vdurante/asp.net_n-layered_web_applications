# What Is A Design Pattern?


> "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over
and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution
to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times
over, without ever doing it the same way twice"

A design pattern is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. It is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

The Gang of Four describes four essential elements:

* **Pattern name.** A word or two used to describe a design problem, its solutions and consequences.
* **Problem.** When to apply the pattern. Explains the problem and its context.
* **Solution.** The elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.
* **Consequences.** Results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.

## The Gang Of Four's Design Patterns.

The Gang of Four describes 23 classic design patterns, divided into 3 categories: creational, structural, and behavioral.

### Creational Design Patterns

The creational design patterns are all about class instantiation, being divided into class-creation patterns and object-creation patterns.

* **Abstract Factory.**
* **Builder.** 
* **Factory Method.**
* **Prototype.**
* **Singleton.**

### Structural Design Patterns

The structural design patterns are all about class and object composition, using inheritance to compose interfaces.

* **Adapter.** 
* **Bridge.**
* **Composite.**
* **Decorator.**
* **Facade.**
* **Flyweight.**
* **Proxy.**

### Behavioral Design Patterns

The behavioral design patterns are all about classes' objects communication. It is concerned with communication between objects.

* **Chain of Responsibility.**
* **Command.**
* **Interpreter.**
* **Iterator.**
* **Mediator.**
* **Memento.** 
* **Observer.**
* **State.**
* **Strategy.**
* **Template Method.**
* **Visitor.**

## The Design Patterns That Matter.

Although it is extremely advised to learn, understand and apply the patterns presented above, not all of them are entirely necessary to work on a N-Layer Architecture. Moreover, some modern patterns are not described by the Gang of Four's book.

Design patterns should be applied as needed, varying from application to application.
