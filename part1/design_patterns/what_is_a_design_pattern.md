# What Is A Design Pattern?


> "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over
and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution
to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times
over, without ever doing it the same way twice"

A design pattern is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. It is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

The Gang of Four describes four essential elements:

* **Pattern name.** A word or two used to describe a design problem, its solutions and consequences.
* **Problem.** When to apply the pattern. Explains the problem and its context.
* **Solution.** The elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.
* **Consequences.** Results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.

# The Gang Of Four's patterns.

The Gang of Four describes 23 classic design patterns, divided into 3 categories: creational, structural, and behavioral.
