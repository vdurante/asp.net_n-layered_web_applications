# What Is Software Architecture
> Software application architecture is the process of defining a structured solution that meets all of the technical and operational requirements, while optimizing common quality attributes such as performance, security, and manageability. It involves a series of decisions based on a wide range of factors, and each of these decisions can have considerable impact on the quality, performance, maintainability, and overall success of the application.
> -- <cite>Microsoft Application Architecture Guide, 2nd Edition</cite>

Whenever building a software, important decisions must be taken in order to achieve the great goal: success. Between these decisions, the important ones are:

* **Quality attributes.** Selecting non-functional requirements to evaluate the performance of the system .
* **Environment.** Choosing the right infrastructure, regarding software, hardware, network and services. The environment must satisfy the requirements of the desired system.
* **Design.** Description of the elements of a system. Defining how these elements fit together and  interact with each other.
*  **Human interaction.** How humans fit inside the system, whether they are stakeholders, developers or users.
*  **Business strategy.** Defining strategies that allow the organization to achieve its long-term objectives.
