# What Is Object-Oriented Programming?

Opposed to classic procedural programming, which describes a program as a composition of actions organized in a logical flow, object-oriented programming organizes code around classes and objects. An object is the instantiation of a class: self-contained components of an application that have private functionality as well as public functionality that can be exposed to the user.
