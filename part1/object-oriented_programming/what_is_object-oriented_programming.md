# What Is Object-Oriented Programming?

Opposed to classic procedural programming, which describes a program as a composition of actions organized in a logical flow, object-oriented programming organizes code around classes and objects. An object is the instantiation of a class: self-contained components of an application that have private functionality as well as public functionality that can be exposed to the user.

## Important Concepts

* **Class.** A template or set of instructions (methods) and data (attributes) to build a specific object.
* **Methods.** The capabilities (or functions) of a class.
* **Attribute.** The properties of a class, such as variables.
* **Object.** An instance of a class. The concretization of the template of a class into a concrete object.
* **Encapsulation.** A group of methods and attributes that are encapsulated, meaning that are treated as a single unit or object.
* **Inheritance.** The ability to create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting methods, attributes, strucutre.
* **Polymorphism.** Multiple classes that implement the same properties and methods, but in different ways. Due to this fact, they can be used interchangeably.
