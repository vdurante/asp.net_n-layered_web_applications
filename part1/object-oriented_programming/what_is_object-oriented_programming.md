# What Is Object-Oriented Programming?

Opposed to classic procedural programming, which describes a program as a composition of actions organized in a logical flow, object-oriented programming organizes code around classes and objects. An object is the instantiation of a class: self-contained components of an application that have private functionality as well as public functionality that can be exposed to the user.

## Important Concepts

* **Class.** A template or set of instructions (methods) and data (attributes) to build a specific object.
* **Methods.** The capabilities (or functions) of a class.
* **Attribute.** The properties of a class, such as variables.
* **Encapsulation.** 
* **Inheritance.** 
* **Polymorphism.**
