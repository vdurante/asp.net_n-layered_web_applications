# Types

  C# is a strongly-typed language. This means that every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression (i.e. method, or function) that evaluates to a type. Every method specifies a type for each input argument, as well as for the return value.
  
  There is also a *var* type, which declares a implicit type. It is strongly-typed as well, but the compiler determines the type.
